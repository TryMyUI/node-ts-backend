Mean , so this is general information about the team , the best ranking items , uh the pain points that we have areas for opportunity , um engagement index , that's not too bad , 74% engagement ratio and resources .\nOK .\nSo , um let's see , how would I do that ? Um I would probably just the easiest way I think that I would do that is probably leveraging this search box here where it says primary team .\nUh and just typing her name , I would assume that you can type a name .\nUh Another thing that I would expect to be able to do is click on the plus sign and select her name , Jane Smith .\nUm And , and I would be able to see the report of her group .\nSo the reporting group under Jean Smith would be able to see that .\nSo this is just the primary team , Jones Ri I think that's my name , right , Riley Jones .\nSo that's everyone under me .\nUh And I think that by looking up her name here or adding a plus right here and filtering through , clearing all those reporting groups and then filtering through and getting her name there , I think that I would um be able to get her results .\nUh So I would say a five uh easy .\nUh I don't think it's that difficult , but I don't think it's super obvious either .\nSo I think it would take me a little bit of clicking around to be able to understand and figure out how to do it .\nSo I would say it's a five out"

Uh Yes , that's pretty much one of the , one of the versions that I had in mind .\nSo I , I thought maybe I'll have to click on that and type her name or I can click on the plus sign .\nNow , what I'm curious about is uh why do I have so many names here with different reporting groups ? So I guess it's gonna create a reporting group every single time .\nUm But I'm not sure .\nUh So is uh Jane Smith where you expected ? Yes , pretty much .\nThat's kind of what I , what I expected to happen .\nThe questions that I have are , should I remove some of those filters ? What will happen if I use the search bar ? And what about those reporting groups ? Uh Should I clear something or is it the more you add , the more it uh adds on um a add , adds groups to your uh reporting ? I'm not sure about that , but yeah , this task was fairly easy .\nSeven"

Because he doesn't really directly report to me it , reports to Jane .\nSo I would think that now this , this little org chart , um , tab here or icon shows that if I select someone it's gonna show Jane Dire Jane's direct reports .\nSo I would probably do the same thing .\nClick on plus and get , uh , Casey Dutton if I can , I don't know if I can or maybe click on reporting group .\nNot exactly sure how I would do that , but I see Casey Dutton .\nSo how would I see Casey's results ? So Jane is here and Casey is , I cannot do anything .\nYeah , I would probably just click on plus and try to get Casey Dutton , but it's not working for some reason .\nSo this is probably what I would do because it looks like this , Jane .\nSo if I go up , I'm selected and I see my direct reports and then as she's selected now and I can see her direct report .\nSo I would probably , you know , click on , uh uh Casey right here .\nUh Again , I would say it's a five just because it's not super clear the way it's laid out here , it's not very easily unders understandable , it's not glaringly obvious or anything .\nSo , to me that's probably just a five because , uh it looks a little weird how it's working like that .\nUh And I'm still not sure since none of that is changing what I'm seeing now , I would expect would be Jane Smith's reporting group including Casey's results .\nUh And if I just click on Casey's , it would just narrow it down to simply Casey's results .\nUh Is what I suspect at least ."
